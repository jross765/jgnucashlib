# Project "JGnuCash Lib 'n' Tools"

`JGnuCashLib` is a free and open-source Java library for reading and writing the XML file 
format of the GnuCash open source accounting software 
([gnucash.org](https://gnucash.org)).

It is not directly affiliated with / sponsored or coordinated by the developers of the 
GnuCash project.

## Modules and Further Details

* [Base](https://github.com/jross765/jgnucashlib/tree/master/gnucash-base/README.md)

* [API](https://github.com/jross765/jgnucashlib/tree/master/gnucash-api/README.md)

* [API Extensions](https://github.com/jross765/jgnucashlib/tree/master/gnucash-api-ext/README.md)

* [Example Programs](https://github.com/jross765/jgnucashlib/tree/master/gnucash-api-examples/README.md)

* [Tools](https://github.com/jross765/jgnucashlib/tree/master/gnucash-tools/README.md)

## Compatibility
### System Compatibility
Version 1.4 of the library has been tested with 
GnuCash 5.5 on Linux (locale de_DE) and 
OpenJDK 17.0.

Java 11 or earlier won't work.

### Locale/Language Compatibility
**Caution:** Will only work on systems with the following locale languages:

* English
* French
* Spanish
* German

However, it has **not** been thoroughly tested with all of them, but just on a system 
with locale de_DE (for details, cf. the API module documentation).

### Version Compatibility

| Version | Backward Compat. | Note                           |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1.5     | (WIP) almost?    | Only minor changes             |
| 1.4     | no               | Some substantial changes       |
| 1.3     | no               | "Medium" changes in interfaces |
| 1.2     | no               | Minor changes in interfaces    |
| 1.1     | no               | Major changes in interfaces    |
| 1.0.1   | yes              |                                |

## Major Changes
Here, only the top-level changes on module-level are mentioned. For more Details, 
cf. the README files of the resp. modules (links above).

### V. 1.4 &rarr; 1.5 (WIP)
* Added module "Tools".

* New external dependency (outside of Maven central): [`SchnorxoLib`](https://github.com/jross765/schnorxolib), a small library that contains some auxiliary stuff that is used both in this and the sister project.

### V. 1.3 &rarr; 1.4
Changed project structure:

* Introduced new module "Base" (spun off from "API").

	This was necessary because the author is using the new module in other, external projects (not published).

* Introduced new module "API Extensions"

	Currently, this module it is very small. It will (hopefully) grow.

### V. 1.2 &rarr; 1.3 and Before
Cf. the README file of modules "API" and "Example programs" (links below).

## Level of Maturity
This software is still in its beta stage.

Although the author, at this stage, feels more or less comfortable with using this
library for write-access (given all the test cases he has contributed), he still 
recommends not just taking it and "wildly" changing things in your valuable GnuCash
files that you may have been building for years or possibly even decades. Although 
he is using it for his own needs, he reckons that it still contains non-trivial bugs,
and it definitely has not been sufficiently exposed to real-world data yet to blindly 
rely on it working correctly in all conceivable edge and corner cases.

In other words: **Make backups before you use this lib!** Take your time and check
the generated/changed files thoroughly before moving on.

## Compiling the Sources
To compile the sources, do the following:

1) Make sure that you have Maven installed on your system.

2) Clone the [`SchnorxoLib`](https://github.com/jross765/schnorxolib) repository, compile it and install the resulting JAR file in your local repository by typing:

    `$ ./build.sh`

     Then, either copy the resulting file to whereever you want to have it, 
     or do it the standard Maven way be typing:

    `$ mvn install`

3) Clone this repository and compile the sources:
    a) Adapt the path to your local repository in *all* pom.xml files (search for "`schnorxolib-base-systemPath`").
    b) Type:

        `$ ./build.sh`

## Sister Project
This project has a sister project: 
[`JKMyMoneyLib`](https://github.com/jross765/jkmymoneylib)

Both projects have roughly the same level of maturity, `JGnuCashLib` currently being a little 
more advanced than `JKMyMoneyLib`. Obviously, the author strives to keep both projects 
symmetrical and to eventually have them both on a comparable level of maturity.

What is meant by "symmetry" is this context? It means that `JKMyMoneyLib` has, in the early
stages, literally evolved from a source-code copy of its sister, this project). 
Meanwhile, changes and adaptations are going in both directions.
Given that KMyMoney and GnuCash are two finance applications with quite a few 
similarities (both in business logic and file format), this approach makes sense
and has been working well so far.

Of course, this is a "10.000-metre bird's-eye view". As always in life, things are a little more
complicated once you go into the details. Still, looking at the big picture and at least 
up to the current state of development, the author has managed to keep both projects very 
similar on a source code level -- so much so that you partially can use `diff`. You will, 
however, also see some exceptions here and there where that "low-level-symmetry" is not 
maintainable.

Special thanks to:

* **Marcus Wolschon (Sofware-Design u. Beratung)** for the original version (from 2005) and 
  the pioneering work (which, by the way, contained way more than what you see here) and for 
  putting the base of this project under the GPL.

    This project is based on Marcus's work. There have been major changes since then, but you can still see where it originated from.
